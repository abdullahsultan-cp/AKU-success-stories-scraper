My son just wouldn't latch. He wasn't feeding, remained colicky, and cried through the nights. My exhaustion, worry, and sleeplessness quickly spiralled into postpartum depression. I was overwhelmed and drowning in self-doubt.\n\nBecause my baby wouldn't latch, my milk supply dropped drastically. As a shy new mother, I didn't feel comfortable asking family members for help. Instead, I turned to Google and YouTube at odd hours of the night, desperately searching for tips and tricks, but nothing worked.\n\nI would manually pump for hours, then spend more hours trying to feed him. I barely left my room. I had no idea how to make him latch. I didn't know which breast pump to use or how to use it properly. My self-confidence was shattered.\n\nFor three months, I pumped milk relentlessly, clinging to the hope that things would eventually improve. But they didn't. I was ready to give up.\n\nThen one day, I stumbled upon a Facebook post from a mother abroad talking about something I'd never heard of: lactation consultants. It was the first time I realised that there were professionals who actually helped with breastfeeding problems. I wondered, do such experts even exist in Pakistan?\n\nBy the grace of the Almighty, I discovered that Aga Khan University Hospital offered Lactation Consultant Services. Ms. Kiran Mubeen and Ms. Marina Hashwani, the AKUH Lactation Consultants, were both internationally certified.* I mainly worked with Ms. Mubeen, and just meeting her was a turning point. She wasn't just a healthcare provider; she was a source of warmth and comfort. For the first time in months, I felt seen and heard.\n\nUnlike many doctors who rush to prescribe medication, Ms. Mubeen took the time to listen. She asked about my daily routine, assessed my challenges, and created a realistic, manageable plan for me. My baby still didn't latch — I had hoped he eventually would — but she gently explained that it was okay. What mattered most was that he receives breast milk, however possible.\n\nMs. Mubeen taught me stimulation techniques, the right pump to use, and improved my diet. At the time I met her, I was producing just 3 oz of milk a day. Within a short span, that number grew to 10 oz. I was able to cut down on formula and feed my baby expressed milk all day.\n\nWhat truly touched me was her follow-up. She checked in on me. She genuinely cared about how I was doing.\n\nAlthough my baby never latched, I didn't give up. I continued pumping and feeding him expressed breast milk for 1.5 years. It wasn't easy, but I did it, because I believe breast milk is the purest, most powerful gift a mother can give her child.\n\nToday, I want other mothers to know they are not alone.\n\nWe need more awareness in Pakistan. So many young women silently suffer, not knowing who to ask for help, or even that help exists. Many give up, not because they want to, but because they feel helpless.\n\nLet's change that. Let's talk openly about these struggles. Let's ensure that no new mother feels isolated, misunderstood, or unsupported, the way I once did.​\n\n*International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners (IBLCE) certified.",
