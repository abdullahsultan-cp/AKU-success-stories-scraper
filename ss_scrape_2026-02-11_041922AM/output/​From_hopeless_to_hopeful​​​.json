  "body_text": "Upon reaching the hospital, Owais was rushed to the OR. He was in immense pain, but doctors assured the family he was expected to fully recover. Little did everyone know, the worst was yet to come.\n\nOwais developed a debilitating infection in both his arm and leg. His older brother recalls the trying time, “Owais was in such a lot of pain. It was so bad that he couldn't even walk with support, let alone on his own. He would fall after just a few steps. It was so hard for us to see him like this, and even harder to see, how with each passing day, he was losing hope.\"\n\nOwais's family felt desperate, they didn't know how to help their brother, until one day a kind soul saw their pain and suggested that they take Owais to Aga Khan University Hospital. “We didn't have the means to get treatment at Aga Khan Hospital, but our despair made us put our faith in Allah and we went to the hospital.\"\n\nOwais was guided to Patients' Behbud Society (PBS) by the doctor they were refered to, Dr. Rizwan. There they found there was hope. “We received tremendous cooperation from PBS and the doctors and with all the help we were able to start Owais's treatment at Aga Khan University Hospital,\" Owais's brother expressed with gratitude.\n\nOwais had suffered bone loss due to the infection which caused a limp. Dr. Rizwan employed a cutting-edge technique which is practiced by only three specialized surgeons at AKUH. “Assisting me was Dr. Yasir who will now help in limb lengthening - a procedure required because of bone loss due to the infection. God willing, we will be able to make him walk on his two feet in 6 to 8 months,\" explained and assured Dr. Rizwan.\n\nAfter the treatment there is a marked improvement in Owais and now that lost smile is returning to his face. “I feel much better – I couldn't walk before but now I feel 100% more hopeful,\" said Owais.\n\nOwais has transformed from a hopeless young man to a one more hopeful after his treatment at Aga Khan University Hospital. His story got rewritten because of those countless donors who offer financial support, donation and zakat to the Patients' Behbud Society for AKUH (PBS), so patients like Owais, have a chance at life again.\n\nTo donate, click here.\n\nFor further information:\n\nCall: +92 300 072 3000 | +92 21 3486 3000\n\nFacebook: The Patient's Behbud Society for Aga Khan University Hospital\n\nEmail: patients.behbud@aku.edu​​",
