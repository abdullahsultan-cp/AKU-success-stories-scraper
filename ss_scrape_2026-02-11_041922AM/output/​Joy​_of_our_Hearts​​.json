It was eventually diagnosed that my child had a hole in his heart which required expensive surgery. I prostrated to Allah (swt) and implored him. Friends guided us to the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) where we were assured medical assistance and help through PBS and Patient Welfare.\n\nThe successful surgery was conducted by an expert team of health professionals with love and respect and the generosity of the donors who opened their hearts for people like us, brought tears of gratitude in our eyes and duas for them as long as we live.\n\nToday, Muhammad Moiz is a healthy, playful three-year-old with a big smile on his face.\"\n\nMuhammad Ijaz Khan and his wife are not the first parents to experience the pain, suffering and worry caused by their financial circumstances.
