  "body_text": "Her persistent labour caused her to develop an abdominal hernia. A kindly neighbour arranged surgery for her at a small local hospital, but the surgery failed. The surgeon did not insert the mesh required to heal the hernia, and her condition worsened. Gul Bano lived in sheer agony for the next 3 years. All this time, due to the restrictions placed on her by strict cultural customs, Gul Bano remained confined to her rented house in Kati Pahari, Karachi, sobbing her pain away. Not knowing where to turn, in her weakest moments, when the pain was at its most intense, Gul Bano says she prayed for deliverance through death, but at her most hopeful she prayed for help.\n\nGod answered her prayers. Gul Bano's family was selected by Project L-O-V-E, a local NGO. Project L-O-V-E brought Gul Bano to the Aga Khan University Hospital. There, with the help of the Patients' Behbud Society at AKUH, she was immediately afforded best-in-class healthcare. Gul Bano underwent a successful surgery in which her hernia was treated and damage from her previous botched surgery was repaired. Follow-up visits later confirmed that Gul Bano was healing very well.\n\nGul Bano is now essentially cured. She prays five times a day, thanking Allah SWT for all the donors of The Patients' Behbud Society who gave her a new lease on life and a hope-filled future.\n\nClick​ to view Gul's story in her own words.",
