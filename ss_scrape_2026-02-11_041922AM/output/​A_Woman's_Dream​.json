  "body_text": "​“It was during my K-2 summit attempt in 2014 when I noticed that I was facing a serious health problem,” recalls Samina Baig.\n\nSamina is a professional mountain climber, and injuries feel like part of the package. However, this time, she says, it was different. She first noticed the sharp pain in the year 2012. It extended from her neck, down along her left arm. Dismissing it as insignificant at that time, Samina chose to relieve her pain with medications and hoped it would subside. It was only during the K-2 summit attempt, when she faced a minor accident, that she was forced to seek medical advice for the persistent pain.\n\nSamina initially got herself medically examined by doctors residing in Islamabad. Unable to get an accurate diagnosis, she then sought medical advice from the internationally trained medical faculty working with the Orthopaedics team at The Aga Khan University Hospital.\n\nSamina communicated her symptoms to Dr. Masood Umer, Orthopaedic Surgeon, at The Aga Khan University Hospital. She described that she felt a current like shooting pain down her arm and was losing sensation in the ring and little finger of her left hand. Dr. Masood immediately diagnosed the physical discomfort as Ulnar Nerve Entrapment at the left elbow. He explained that the medical complaint will require immediate surgery.\n\nA medical team comprising of one surgeon, one surgical technician, two residents and anaesthetists conducted a surgery lasting around two hours. The surgical procedure included making an incision under Samina’s left triceps to free the entrapped nerve. The surgery was a success and was able to give 80% relief to Samina, who said,“After the surgery, I am mentally confident about carrying out my expeditions without the stress of any physical discomfort.”\n\nSamina was advised to rest for three months. She was also prescribed painkillers to settle the nerve down.\n\nCommenting on the services at The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Samina said,\n\n“The system at The Aga Khan University Hospital is commendable. From management to the services, I would declare it as the number one hospital in the country”.\n\nSamina was able to resume climbing in early 2019. She reaffirmed her committment to the Pakistan Youth Outreach Program, which is involved in conducting mountaineering training and ski camps. Samina hopes to encourage the youth of the country to pursue their passions like she did and strive for personal growth and excellence.​",
