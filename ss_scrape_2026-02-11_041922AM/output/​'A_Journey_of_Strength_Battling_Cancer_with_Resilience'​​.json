  "body_text": "In the words of one of our brave cancer patients, Sabeen Abbas\n\nWhen you hear the word 'cancer', your world changes in an instant. That moment of realization shakes you to your core. For me, it wasn't just the fear of the disease but the unknown journey ahead. The quick action of my doctor and care team at AKUH set the stage for what could otherwise have been a very different outcome.\n\nFacing cancer is a test of strength, both physically and emotionally. It's not as simple as taking medicine and recovering in a few days. Battling cancer is nothing like fighting a viral infection - it's an exhausting and long fight, filled with chemotherapy, surgeries, radiation, and endless tests. These treatments aren't just difficult - they're painful, draining, and at times, feel insurmountable. But I feel, even in these darkest moments, keeping my mind focused and my attitude positive, has made the difference between despair and hope.\n\nFamily and friends became my pillars of strength, lifting me when I couldn't lift myself. The support I received wasn't just words of encouragement—it was a lifeline. Their presence allowed me the freedom to express my frustrations, even if that meant responding with harsh words or silence. And for that, I am forever grateful. I am especially grateful for my husband's steadfast support which gave me the strength to continue. He has been my rock, my courage, and continues to stand by me every step of the way.\n\nI was fortunate not only to be surrounded by love, from my family and friends but also the incredible care team I found at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH). From the first consultation to my recovery, the professionalism and compassion I found in everyone at AKUH were unmatched. Dr. Atif Siddiqui performed my surgery, while Dr. Nadeem Abbasi and Dr. Salman Adil guided me through the healing process. Dr. Salman Adil, one of the best haematologists in Pakistan, also helped me understand the disease and treatment in a way that brought clarity and comfort in a time of great distress.\n\nThe entire medical team, from doctors to nurses, treated me with care that went beyond the clinical treatment. They saw me as a human being, as a person, and not just a patient. Their compassion, kindness and understanding, gave me the strength to endure the toughest days. I feel immense gratitude for the feeling they gave me – like I was safe and well cared for, like I was not alone even when away from my loved ones.\n\nThis journey through cancer has been a battle, but with faith, family, and the incredible team at AKUH, I found the strength to fight. My story is not just one of survival but one of gratitude - for every prayer, every kind word, and every act of care that carried me through.\n\nTo anyone facing a similar diagnosis, my advice is this: Accept the reality, seek the right treatment, gather your strength, and fight with unwavering determination. You can defeat this monster and emerge stronger.\n\nSabeen Abbas is a mathematician and a blogger. She has been a teacher for many years and enjoys painting and vlogging in her leisure time.",
