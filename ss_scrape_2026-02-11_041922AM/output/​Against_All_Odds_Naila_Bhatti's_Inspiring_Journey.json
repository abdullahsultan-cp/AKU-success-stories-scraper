  "body_text": "This is Naila's remarkable story.\n\nBorn with Bulbar Polio, the most severe and dangerous form of the polio disease, Naila had all odds stacked against her the moment she entered this world.\n\nBulbar Polio occurs when the poliovirus attacks the brain and spinal cord, leading to extremely weakened muscles, severe breathing problems and paralysis in different parts of the body. Less than 1% of people with polio get bulbar polio. Naila's case was rare – doctors at AKUH had never seen anything similar before. They put in all their efforts to save the baby's life.\n\nNaila was saved, but due to muscle weakness, lost mobility in the lower half of her body. It was also clear that she would have to remain on a ventilator, wheelchair, and under constant care for the rest of her life.\n\nThis reality proved too challenging for Naila's family, and they abandoned her at the hospital.\n\nLeft in the care of doctors and hospital staff, Naila spent the first five years of her life on a vent in the ICU at AKUH. When she was six, she was finally strong enough to be moved to the ward. Naila then spent around 14 years at the Paediatric Ward at AKUH.\n\nNaila grew up on the grounds of AKUH and even after leaving the ward, continues to live in the hospital's hostel to this day. “I have always had supportive people around me,\" Naila says.\n\nShe recalls her time in the Paediatrics ward very fondly: “I was the favourite of everyone there.\" Naila remembers how the doctors, nurses, and support staff always treated her like family and never made her feel as if anything was wrong.\n\n“I was a very naughty child,\" Naila says. “I used to wander around on my own and often got lost.\" Indulging Naila in her mischievous escapades, the staff and patients of the ward showered her with attention and care.\n\nNaila's education was not ignored. She started attending the C.A.S School from the age of six and with the support of its principal, Mr. Sami Mustafa, successfully completed her O Levels, followed by her A Levels from Southshore College.\n\n“I have a passion for studying and I want to grow my career,\" says Naila. She has been working for 12 years as an Assistant Librarian at the non-profit organization HANDS.\n\nNaila's journey is marked by the constant presence of supportive individuals. Dr Shahnaz Ibrahim, Paediatric Neurologist at AKUH, has been a pillar of support throughout Naila's life, aiding in medical treatments, studies, and everyday challenges. Dr Gaffar Billoo, Consultant Paediatrician at AKUH and philanthropist, played a pivotal role in helping Naila secure her job and has helped manage financial matters for her as well.\n\nAs Naila shared her incredible story with us, she mentioned another milestone moment of her life. She embraced her faith after exploring different religions. “I decided to become Muslim after my 18th birthday.\"\n\nWith the help of her caretakers and Dr Shahnaz Ibrahim, she learned to offer namaz and took an Arabic course, finding more on her identity and spirituality in the process.\n\nReflecting on her journey, Naila says: “Just like anyone else, ups and downs are part of my life.\"\n\nNaila encourages others to believe in themselves, asserting the importance of perseverance and never giving up. After all, Naila herself is living proof that one can overcome any obstacle with determination and the right support.\n\nNaila's story attests to the power of resilience, the impact of supportive individuals, and the triumph of the human spirit against adversity.",
