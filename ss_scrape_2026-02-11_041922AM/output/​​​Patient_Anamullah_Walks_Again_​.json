  "body_text": "It was not only Amanullah, but his entire family was also struggling because of his pain and immobility. However, Amanullah did not lose hope and the motivation to start walking again. After five years of struggle, and many rounds of consultation and treatment at various private hospitals in Karachi, he and his family decided to come to the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) for treatment.\n\nAmanullah and his family met Dr. Mujahid Jamil, a UK trained Orthopedic surgeon with special expertise in Hip and Knee Surgery, in February 2019 for the first time.\n\nThey discussed his medical history in detail. “We were pleasantly surprised by the empathetic care and cooperation of Dr. Mujahid and his entire team. We were provided with the Doctor’s personal contact details in case of any questions or concerns”, said Maryam Asad, daughter of Amanullah.\n\nWhile discussing his complex and challenging two-stage knee replacement surgery that was then carried out in May 2019, Amanullah recalled how Dr. Mujahid had comforted and provided moral support to him and his family prior to the surgery. As he stood up for the first time after the surgery, using his walking aide, the tying strings of his trousers were obstructing his first steps. Immediately Dr. Mujahid noticed and instantly knelt down to tie the strings. “I saw him tying the strings of my trousers and I was deeply touched to see his compassionate gesture”, said Amanullah who had been waiting five years to be cured.\n\nWhile speaking on nursing care, Amanullah shared his experience to be excellent. The nursing staff made sure that they educated his family on home care, such as dressing changes and avoiding bedsores.\n\n“Because of my exceptional experience of the care and treatment I received, I now insist on coming only to the Aga Khan University Hospital for all types of healthcare consultation”, remarked Amanullah.\n\nAmanullah underwent physiotherapy for several months after the surgery and showed remarkable signs of recovery. The pain in his knee has now completely disappeared and mobility has improved to the extent that he can stand on his feet and walk comfortably using the walking aid. Amanullah remains positive and is looking forward to walking without any support in the very near future.",
