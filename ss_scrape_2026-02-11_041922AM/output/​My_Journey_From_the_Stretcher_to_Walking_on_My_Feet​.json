  "body_text": "The kind doctor suggested that I approach the Patients' Behbud Society for AKUH. But I was in daze. I didn't mention anything to my mother, just went back to work. The pain went on increasing. I lost my job, and ultimately my brother took me to the Aga Khan University Hospital on a stretcher. He approached the Patients' Behbud Society for AKUH. They took over the financial side of things. With their help, I was operated on and given chemotherapy for my cancer treatment. During all this time, I felt I received the highest level of healthcare.\n\nToday, I walked out of the hospital on my own feet. My mother's eyes were filled with tears – she prays for everyone who made this possible for us.\"\n\nYour Zakat and Sadaqat to the Patients' Behbud Society for AKUH provides such needy patients with new hope and a chance with life.
