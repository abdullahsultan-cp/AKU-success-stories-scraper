  "body_text": "Abdul Aziz Bhojani is a well-liked member of his community, with his warm personality. Today he is enjoying his retirement, but this is a story of 1991 when he used to work as a building construction supervisor, where he was known for his unwavering commitment to his work. One fateful day in February of that year, he was struck by excruciating head pain that rendered him almost completely helpless.\n\nRecognizing the severity of his condition, Abdul Aziz's family wasted no time and swiftly brought him to the still relatively new Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) in Karachi, Pakistan. AKUH had started operations only six years earlier, in 1985, but was already known as the best hospital in the city and beyond.\n\nOnce he arrived, the medical team wasted no time and ran tests on him to understand the reason for such excruciating pain. The results were both startling and concerning.\n\nAbdul Aziz's MRI revealed he had in fact suffered from a left cerebral hemisphere infarct—a stroke. The gravity of his situation intensified as further investigations uncovered a carotid body tumour, a rare form of tumours that develop in the neck. Abdul Aziz's tumour measured a daunting 6x4 cm, and was dangerously close to major arteries, posing a significant threat to his wellbeing.\n\nIt was then at AKUH, that Abdul Aziz's journey of healing began, under the compassionate care of an exceptional multidisciplinary medical team. This team of experts came together to formulate a comprehensive plan for Abdul Aziz's surgery and treatment. The ground-breaking operation was to be the first of its kind for these skilled doctors, who left no stone unturned in ensuring the best possible outcome for their patient.\n\nDespite the complexity of the surgery and the inherent risks of haemorrhage and stroke, Abdul Aziz remained resolute, finding solace in the unwavering support and care provided by the AKUH team. Grateful for their expertise and dedication, he reflects even now, 32 years later, \"If it weren't for AKUH, I would not have made it back in 1991.\"\n\nAlthough the operation resulted in the loss of his voice, Abdul Aziz's spirit remained unbroken. With continuous care and support, he began the arduous process of recovery. The road ahead was challenging, with occasional absence spells and lingering uncertainties. However, fuelled by his determination and buoyed by the unwavering support of his family and the AKUH Patient Welfare Programme, Abdul Aziz took the first steps towards regaining his life.\n\nOver time, his strength and resilience triumphed over adversity. Gradually, Abdul Aziz returned to his beloved profession, working diligently to regain his former abilities. It took a year of steadfast effort, but he emerged stronger and more appreciative of life's precious moments.​\n\nThrough his remarkable journey, Abdul Aziz became a testament to the transformative power of medical expertise and the unwavering support of loved ones. AKUH, with its unparalleled commitment to patient care and ground-breaking treatments, had not only saved his life but also created immeasurable value in the lives of countless individuals connected to Abdul Aziz.\n\nToday, Abdul Aziz Bhojani stands as a living testament to the resilience of the human spirit. His extraordinary tale of overcoming adversity serves as an inspiration to all who face seemingly insurmountable challenges. With unwavering determination, the support of loved ones, and the exceptional care provided by institutions like AKUH, he has continued to embrace life and its joys in gratitude and hope.\n\nTo donate, click here.\n\nFor further information:\n\nCall: +92 300 072 3000 | +92 21 3486 3000\n\nFacebook: The Patient's Behbud Society for Aga Khan University Hospital\n\nEmail: patients.behbud@aku.edu​​​",
