  "body_text": "Arzoo Saltanat, a cancer survivor, has this message for all women:\n\n\"Look after your body. Have regular check-ups and seek professional help immediately if you feel that something is wrong. Don't ignore symptoms, as I did. I did not know what the consequences of ignoring my health would be.\"\n\nArzoo Saltanat is a native of Gilgit, a mountainous region to the north of Pakistan. For the last three years, an ordeal has overshadowed Arzoo's life: her fight against cancer. Arzoo seems too delicate to have fought off cancer - and too young to have been diagnosed with it in the first place.\n\nBut cancer strikes women regardless of their race, ethnicity, age or occupation.\n\nSadly, Arzoo detected something unusual in her breasts, but ignored the symptoms of her illness for several months. She was unaware of the risk of breast cancer. She was also busy pursuing her job and professional interests in Karachi, after moving here from Gilgit in 2008. Finally, her younger sister, who is a student of nursing at the Aga Khan University, suggested that she have a check up.\n\nA visit to Aga Khan University Hospital saved Arzoo's life. A test result revealed that she had breast cancer. Dr Shaisa, her physician, recommended surgery and went as far as speaking to Arzoo's parents, in order to motivate her to start treatment for the illness.\n\nArzoo was very scared after she heard her diagnosis.\n\nFor further information:​​\n\nCall: +92 300 072 3000 | +92 21 3486 3000\n\nFacebook: The Patient's Behbud Society for Aga Khan University Hospital\n\nEmail: patients.behbud@aku.edu​​​​​​",
